### ðŸ’¡ My Learning Experience (In My Own Words  Bilal Khan )

Honestly, I learned HTML, CSS, and JS mostly by watching tutorials. But after creating this simple card project, I realized that just watching tutorials doesn't mean I really *know* the skill.

When I started this QR card challenge, I was blank! Even though I had watched many videos, I was confused because tutorials only show steps â€” but I wasnâ€™t practicing before.

Now, Iâ€™m trying to practice on my own by solving real problems and designing something from scratch.

Today, I created a simple card structure.

When I started, I thought I understood Flexbox and Grid, but while building this QR card, I struggled.

At first, I just worked on a single `div` with Flexbox and added some colors to see the structure.

But my card was stretching to the whole page because I didnâ€™t use a parent container (body) with Flexbox.

After I applied Flexbox to the `body` element, my card finally came to the center properly.

Then I faced another issue â€” I wanted to center the text inside the card.

At first, I tried using `align-items` and `justify-content`, but the text wasnâ€™t centered as I expected.  
Later, I understood that I needed `text-align: center` to center the text inside the card.

âœ… Hereâ€™s what I learned:
- Flexbox for page centering (with `body` as the container).
- The difference between `align-items`/`justify-content` (for layout) and `text-align` (for text).
- Creating card width properly instead of making it full width.
- The power of *practicing* instead of just watching tutorials!

This is my honest learning from this QR code component challenge.

Iâ€™m happy I practiced this on my own without following any tutorial.
